# About

See above

***

## Project Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ucuntu/Wiki/)

***

## Naming

The name `ucuntu` was chosen, as it is the easiest way to make fun of Ubuntu that I could come up with easily in 2018. The name may seem offensive to some, I won't change it. Just note that I don't hate Ubuntu in general, the idea is that once a Ubuntu users installs Ucuntu, Ubuntu becomes Ucuntu.
