# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Nobody has asked any questions yet, so I have come up with my own - June 23rd 2020

`{question}` - Why is this malicious?

> I wrote Ucuntu to be a malicious program, as I took inspiration from videos online that showcase malware. I find them interesting. Some series like YouTuber Danooct1s [viewer made malware](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi_KYBWS_E73gG80A5YFjf8ww5H8aJvAl) series interests me.

`{question}` - Is this another flavor of Ubuntu?

> No, this is a piece of malware for Ubuntu. I don't think an operating system with a swear word in its name would be one someone would want to use and promote.

`{question}` - Why is this written mostly in BASH/Shell?

> BASH is a native language to Linux. The original concept didn't take note of this and had a couple VBS (Visual Basic Script) files, and a Python file, but now it is all BASH for Linux. Since Shell is a native language, users don't have to install anything to make it run. I also wanted to make a shell-based repository on GitHub.

`{question}` - Will this trojan work on other Linux versions?

> Most likely. Most of the Shell scripting is similar to that of other Linux distributions, some parts might not be entirely the same, but I wouldn't test it on your host machine, as stated.

`{question}` - Will this trojan work on Windows or MacOS?

> I currently don't know, but you can try to see by doing it in a virtual machine.

`{question}` - Why does it have the swear word in the name?

> Ucuntu is named with a swear word, as that is the name I came up with for it.
